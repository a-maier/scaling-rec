# Rational function reconstruction benchmarks

This repository contains benchmarks to compare different algorithms
for rational function reconstruction implemented in [rare](1). See
[data/Readme.md](data/Readme.md) for more information on the sample
rational functions.

## How to run

If [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/) are installed on your
system, run

    cargo run --release

Note that a run will typically take several minutes.
